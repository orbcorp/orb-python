        This endpoint returns the event volume for an account in a

        The event volume is aggregated by the hour and the
        [timestamp](../reference/ingest#determining-event-timestamp) field is used to
        determine which hour an event is associated with. Note, this means that
        late-arriving events increment the volume count for the hour window the
        timestamp is in, not the latest hour window.

        Each item in the response contains the count of events aggregated by the hour
        where the start and end time are hour-aligned and in UTC. When a specific
        timestamp is passed in for either start or end time, the response includes the
        hours the timestamp falls in.

          timeframe_start: The start of the timeframe, inclusive, in which to return event volume. All

              hour-aligned, the response includes the event volume count for the hour the time
              falls in.

          cursor: Cursor for pagination. This can be populated by the `next_cursor` value returned
              from the initial request.

          limit: The number of items to fetch. Defaults to 20.
