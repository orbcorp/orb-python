    Orb supports a few different pricing models out of the box. Each of these models
    is serialized differently in a given Price object. The model_type field
    determines the key for the configuration object that is present.

    ## Unit pricing

    With unit pricing, each unit costs a fixed amount.

    ```json
    {
        ...
        "model_type": "unit",
        "unit_config": {
            "unit_amount": "0.50"
        }
        ...
    }
    ```

    ## Tiered pricing

    In tiered pricing, the cost of a given unit depends on the tier range that it
    falls into, where each tier range is defined by an upper and lower bound. For
    example, the first ten units may cost $0.50 each and all units thereafter may
    cost $0.10 each.

    ```json
    {
        ...
        "model_type": "tiered",
        "tiered_config": {
            "tiers": [
                {
                    "first_unit": 1,
                    "last_unit": 10,
                    "unit_amount": "0.50"
                },
                {
                    "first_unit": 11,
                    "last_unit": null,
                    "unit_amount": "0.10"
                }
            ]
        }
        ...
    ```

    ## Bulk pricing

    Bulk pricing applies when the number of units determine the cost of all units.
    For example, if you've bought less than 10 units, they may each be $0.50 for a
    total of $5.00. Once you've bought more than 10 units, all units may now be
    priced at $0.40 (i.e. 101 units total would be $40.40).

    ```json
    {
        ...
        "model_type": "bulk",
        "bulk_config": {
            "tiers": [
                {
                    "maximum_units": 10,
                    "unit_amount": "0.50"
                },
                {
                    "maximum_units": 1000,
                    "unit_amount": "0.40"
                }
            ]
        }
        ...
    }
    ```

    ## Package pricing

    Package pricing defines the size or granularity of a unit for billing purposes.
    For example, if the package size is set to 5, then 4 units will be billed as 5
    and 6 units will be billed at 10.

    ```json
    {
        ...
        "model_type": "package",
        "package_config": {
            "package_amount": "0.80",
            "package_size": 10
        }
        ...
    }
    ```

    ## BPS pricing

    BPS pricing specifies a per-event (e.g. per-payment) rate in one hundredth of a
    percent (the number of basis points to charge), as well as a cap per event to
    assess. For example, this would allow you to assess a fee of 0.25% on every
    payment you process, with a maximum charge of $25 per payment.

    ```json
    {
        ...
        "model_type": "bps",
        "bps_config": {
           "bps": 125,
           "per_unit_maximum": "11.00"
        }
        ...
     }
    ```

    ## Bulk BPS pricing

    Bulk BPS pricing specifies BPS parameters in a tiered manner, dependent on the
    total quantity across all events. Similar to bulk pricing, the BPS parameters of
    a given event depends on the tier range that the billing period falls into. Each
    tier range is defined by an upper bound. For example, after $1.5M of payment
    volume is reached, each individual payment may have a lower cap or a smaller
    take-rate.

    ```json
        ...
        "model_type": "bulk_bps",
        "bulk_bps_config": {
            "tiers": [
               {
                    "maximum_amount": "1000000.00",
                    "bps": 125,
                    "per_unit_maximum": "19.00"
               },
              {
                    "maximum_amount": null,
                    "bps": 115,
                    "per_unit_maximum": "4.00"
                }
            ]
        }
        ...
    }
    ```

    ## Tiered BPS pricing

    Tiered BPS pricing specifies BPS parameters in a graduated manner, where an
    event's applicable parameter is a function of its marginal addition to the
    period total. Similar to tiered pricing, the BPS parameters of a given event
    depends on the tier range that it falls into, where each tier range is defined
    by an upper and lower bound. For example, the first few payments may have a 0.8
    BPS take-rate and all payments after a specific volume may incur a take-rate of
    0.5 BPS each.

    ```json
        ...
        "model_type": "tiered_bps",
        "tiered_bps_config": {
            "tiers": [
               {
                    "minimum_amount": "0",
                    "maximum_amount": "1000000.00",
                    "bps": 125,
                    "per_unit_maximum": "19.00"
               },
              {
                    "minimum_amount": "1000000.00",
                    "maximum_amount": null,
                    "bps": 115,
                    "per_unit_maximum": "4.00"
                }
            ]
        }
        ...
    }
    ```

    ## Matrix pricing

    Matrix pricing defines a set of unit prices in a one or two-dimensional matrix.
    `dimensions` defines the two event property values evaluated in this pricing
    model. In a one-dimensional matrix, the second value is `null`. Every
    configuration has a list of `matrix_values` which give the unit prices for
    specified property values. In a one-dimensional matrix, the matrix values will
    have `dimension_values` where the second value of the pair is null. If an event
    does not match any of the dimension values in the matrix, it will resort to the
    `default_unit_amount`.

    ```json
    {
        "model_type": "matrix"
        "matrix_config": {
            "default_unit_amount": "3.00",
            "dimensions": [
                "cluster_name",
                "region"
            ],
            "matrix_values": [
                {
                    "dimension_values": [
                        "alpha",
                        "west"
                    ],
                    "unit_amount": "2.00"
                },
                ...
            ]
        }
    }
    ```

    ### Fixed fees

    Fixed fees are prices that are applied independent of usage quantities, and
    follow unit pricing. They also have an additional parameter
    `fixed_price_quantity`. If the Price represents a fixed cost, this represents
    the quantity of units applied.

    ```json
    {
        ...
        "id": "price_id",
        "model_type": "unit",
        "unit_config": {
           "unit_amount": "2.00"
        },
        "fixed_price_quantity": 3.0
        ...
    }
